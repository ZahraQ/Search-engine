# Search-engine

A search engine is an information retrieval system designed to help find information stored on
a computer system. It helps to minimize the time required to find information and the amount of
information which must be consulted, akin to other techniques for managing information overload.[2]
Actually, we need intelligent search engines to manage big data processing. Find data quickly in a large
database can be very difficult and time consumption. The recent work done in this field aims to produce
high speed and low power results.[1]

This work is concentrated on building a search engine based on hadoop technologies:

· Writing a Map Reduce program “inverted Index” applied on “Books.jason” document.

· Execute this program on Hadoop Streaming (HDFS).

· Load the output generated by Hadoop Streaming in Hbase.

· Scheduling the jobs using Cron.

· Testing the research of key words on Hbase.

· Writing a Script researching a given word.
